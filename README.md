# COP3330C_Inheritance_Project
Dayton Hannaford, CEN-3024C-24204

Project files from my module 2 COP3330C Project

The goal of this project was to create 1 parent and 2 child classes that inherit attributes from the parent. The parent must have a public interface and the child classes must override public interface methods.
The program has a 'Hero' child and 'Villian' child which inherits from 'Fighter' parent class.

Heros are different superheros and Villian is Galactus.

Heros and Villian fight it out once the main is started, printing health loss, increasing and printing stat values as well is quirky story notes. Very rudimentary program.
